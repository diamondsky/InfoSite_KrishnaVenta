				<h2>Who He Is</h2>
				<p>Krishna Venta, otherwise known as Francis Pencovic (1911-1958) was a leader of a religious group in the 1940s and ’50. Krishna claimed to have been born on another planet, long ago and but not so far away—240,000 years ago, on the planet Neophrates He was the founder of the WKFL (Wisdom, Knowledge, Faith and Love) Fountain of the world which was first located in Alaska. The WKFL group became known as the Barefooters because of their habit of going barefoot. In sexual matters, the Fountain of the World was also cult-typical—that is, sexuality was strictly controlled except where it involved Krishna Venta, who was entitled to a kind of droit du messiah when it came to the women.  It was this, in fact, that got this Jesus killed. <br><a href="https://www.skepticink.com/lateraltruth/2014/11/21/krishna-venta-the-christ-of-box-canyon//">More Information</a></p>

				<h2>Barefooters</h2>
				<p>The Wisdom, Knowledge, Faith and Love Fountain of the World followers, as they were known, arrived at the pristine piece of land nestled between the bluff and Fox River six miles from Voznesenka in 1957. Their Homer nickname, "the Barefooters," came from their unusual habit of wearing no shoes, even in the winter. Adding to their mystique were the long monk-like robes they wore. The group eventually broke after Venta was assassinated in 1958, with Asaiah and a few other Barefooters. <br><a href="http://homernews.com/stories/011707/arts_18001.shtml">More Information</a></p>

				<h2>Who He is</h2>
				<p>The Fountain of the World Monastery in a wooded canyon near Chatsworth was ripped apart early yesterday by a heavy explosion which instantly killed the bearded leader of the cult, Krishna Venta, and seven of his followers. The two ex-members, Peter Kamenoff and Ralph Muller, believed Venta had slept with their wives and was misusing the group’s funds. They set off a bomb made with 20 sticks of dynamite.<br><a href="http://framework.latimes.com/2011/01/28/krishna-venta-killed-bombing/#/0">More Information</a></p>
